# AT Protocol implementation in Python

This is _just_ starting, as I begin to grok Bluesky and the AT Protocol.
I'm releasing it super early for educational purposes only.

Set environment variables `BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER` and `BLUESKY_PASSWORD` to run `demo.py`.
The password should be an **App Password**, not your main password.
